I've often used a lot of GPA calculation sites to check what my GPA might look like 
at the end of the quarter based on different scenarios (ex: 2 A's and a B brings my GPA up, 
2 C's and and A brings it down, etc.). These sites were usually cumbersome because of the way 
they allowed input into their system, so I wanted to make a tool that solves that problem.

to run the terminal application:
javac GPA.java
and then:
java GPA
